Reminder Application
The Reminder Application is a simple Python script that allows users to add, view, and manage reminders. Users can set tasks along with specific dates and times, making it easy to keep track of important events.

Features
Add Reminder

Users can add a new reminder by entering the task, date (in the format YYYY-MM-DD), and time (in the format HH:MM).
The application converts the input into a datetime object and adds it to the reminder list.
View Reminders

Users can view a list of all current reminders, including the task and the scheduled date and time.
Exit

Users can exit the application when done.
Default Reminders
The application comes with some default reminders preloaded, including a meeting, report submission, and a birthday party.

How to Use
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
Follow the on-screen menu to add new reminders, view existing reminders, or exit the application.
